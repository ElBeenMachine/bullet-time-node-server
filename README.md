<img src="https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/-/media/ljmu/logos/ljmu_logo_banner_835.jpg" alt="LJMU Banner Logo" />

This repository contains the code and necessary installation scripts to run the node server for our bullet-time project on a Raspberry Pi.

The node server is an individual entity in an array of camera nodes used to create a 360-degree video in bullet-time.

The node server is controlled via the [web interface](https://www.github.com/LJMU-SE/bullet-time-web-app), which will run locally on a control server/client.
